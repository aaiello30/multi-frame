# Multi-frame Tracking Algorithm

The goal of this project is to develop a robust long-term speckle tracking method for rigid body movement analysis in ultrasound image sequence. The following repository contains following projects and the scripts to support the projects

- Speckle Tracking by Correlation Method in Ultrasound ("1.speckle-tracking", Matlab)
- Traditional frame-by-frame tracking algorithm and performance evaluation ("2.frame-by-frame", to be uploaded)
- Multi-frame Tracking algorithm and performance evaluation ("3.multi-frame", to be uploaded)
- Signal de-correlation analysis ("4.decorrelation")
